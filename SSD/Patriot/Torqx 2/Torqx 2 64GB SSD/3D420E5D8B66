SMART Extended Comprehensive Error Log Version: 1 (64 sectors)
Device Error Count: 5
	CR     = Command Register
	FEATR  = Features Register

Powered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as
DDd+hh:mm:SS.sss where DD=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes,
SS=sec, and sss=millisec. It "wraps" after 49.710 days.

Error 5 [4] occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 54 hours (2 days + 6 hours)
