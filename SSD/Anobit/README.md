Anobit Solid State Drives
=========================

This is a list of all tested Anobit solid state drive models and their MTBFs. See
more info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART).

SSD by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days — avg. days per sample,
Err  — avg. errors per sample,
MTBF — avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF   |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| Anobit    | Gen2A400 118032738 | 400 GB | 1       | 96    | 0     | 0.27   |
