AMD Solid State Drives
======================

This is a list of all tested AMD solid state drive models and their MTBFs. See
more info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART).

SSD by Model

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days — avg. days per sample,
Err  — avg. errors per sample,
MTBF — avg. MTBF in years per sample.
