SMART Extended Comprehensive Error Log Version: 1 (1 sectors)
Device Error Count: 9 (device log contains only the most recent 4 errors)
	CR     = Command Register
	FEATR  = Features Register
	COUNT  = Count (was: Sector Count) Register
	LBA_48 = Upper bytes of LBA High/Mid/Low Registers ]  ATA-8

Powered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as
DDd+hh:mm:SS.sss where DD=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes,
SS=sec, and sss=millisec. It "wraps" after 49.710 days.

Error 9 [0] occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 1 hours (0 days + 1 hours)
  When the command that caused the error occurred, the device was active or idle.

  After command completion occurred, registers were:
