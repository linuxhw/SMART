Silicon Solid State Drives
==========================

This is a list of all tested Silicon solid state drive models and their MTBFs. See
more info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART).

SSD by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days - avg. days per sample,
Err  - avg. errors per sample,
MTBF - avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|------|
| Silicon   | SATA3 1TB SSD      | 1 TB   | 3       | 404   | 0     | 1.11   |
| Silicon   | SATA3 120GB SSD    | 120 GB | 2       | 157   | 0     | 0.43   |
| Silicon   | SATA3 240GB SSD    | 240 GB | 3       | 121   | 0     | 0.33   |
