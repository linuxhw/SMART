Wodposit NVMe Drives
====================

This is a list of all tested Wodposit NVMe drive models and their MTBFs. See more
info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART).

NVME by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days - avg. days per sample,
Err  - avg. errors per sample,
MTBF - avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|------|
| Wodposit  | NVMe SSD           | 1 TB   | 18      | 18    | 0     | 0.05   |
| Wodposit  | SSD                | 512 GB | 4       | 6     | 0     | 0.02   |
