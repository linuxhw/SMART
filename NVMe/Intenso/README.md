Intenso NVMe Drives
===================

This is a list of all tested Intenso NVMe drive models and their MTBFs. See more
info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART).

NVME by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days - avg. days per sample,
Err  - avg. errors per sample,
MTBF - avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|------|
| Intenso   | NVME               | 500 GB | 7       | 42    | 0     | 0.12   |
| Intenso   | PCIe               | 480 GB | 5       | 28    | 0     | 0.08   |
| Intenso   | JAJP600M1TB        | 1 TB   | 3       | 4     | 4     | 0.01   |
