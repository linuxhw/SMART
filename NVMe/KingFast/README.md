KingFast NVMe Drives
====================

This is a list of all tested KingFast NVMe drive models and their MTBFs. See more
info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART).

NVME by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days - avg. days per sample,
Err  - avg. errors per sample,
MTBF - avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|------|
| KingFast  | 512GB              | 512 GB | 8       | 123   | 0     | 0.34   |
| KingFast  | 1TB                | 1 TB   | 5       | 114   | 0     | 0.31   |
