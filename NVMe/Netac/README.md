Netac NVMe Drives
=================

This is a list of all tested Netac NVMe drive models and their MTBFs. See more
info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART).

NVME by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days — avg. days per sample,
Err  — avg. errors per sample,
MTBF — avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF   |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| Netac     | NVMe SSD           | 512 GB | 1       | 20    | 0     | 0.06   |
| Netac     | NVMe SSD           | 1 TB   | 2       | 16    | 0     | 0.04   |
