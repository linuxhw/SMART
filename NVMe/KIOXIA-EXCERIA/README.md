KIOXIA-EXCERIA NVMe Drives
==========================

This is a list of all tested KIOXIA-EXCERIA NVMe drive models and their MTBFs. See more
info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART).

NVME by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days — avg. days per sample,
Err  — avg. errors per sample,
MTBF — avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF   |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| KIOXIA... | PLUS SSD           | 1 TB   | 3       | 58    | 0     | 0.16   |
| KIOXIA... | SSD                | 500 GB | 2       | 3     | 0     | 0.01   |
