MMY NVMe Drives
===============

This is a list of all tested MMY NVMe drive models and their MTBFs. See more
info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART).

NVME by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days - avg. days per sample,
Err  - avg. errors per sample,
MTBF - avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|------|
| MMY       | MMSP350            | 512 GB | 4       | 7     | 0     | 0.02   |
| MMY       | HC512GP3KH2T       | 512 GB | 5       | 3     | 0     | 0.01   |
