ASMedia Hard Drives
===================

This is a list of all tested ASMedia hard drive models and their MTBFs. See more
info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART).

HDD by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days — avg. days per sample,
Err  — avg. errors per sample,
MTBF — avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF   |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| ASMedia   | ASMT106x_ V0Safe   | 320 GB | 1       | 103   | 0     | 0.28   |
