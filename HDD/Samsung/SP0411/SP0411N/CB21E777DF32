Warning: ATA error count 1792 inconsistent with error log pointer 5

ATA Error Count: 1792 (device log contains only the most recent five errors)
	CR = Command Register [HEX]

Powered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as
DDd+hh:mm:SS.sss where DD=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes,
SS=sec, and sss=millisec. It "wraps" after 49.710 days.
