Warning: ATA error count 1212 inconsistent with error log pointer 5

ATA Error Count: 1212 (device log contains only the most recent five errors)
	CR = Command Register [HEX]
	FR = Features Register [HEX]
	SC = Sector Count Register [HEX]
	SN = Sector Number Register [HEX]

Powered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as
DDd+hh:mm:SS.sss where DD=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes,
SS=sec, and sss=millisec. It "wraps" after 49.710 days.

Error 1212 occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 32115 hours (1338 days + 3 hours)
