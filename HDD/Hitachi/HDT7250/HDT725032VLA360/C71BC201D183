SMART Extended Comprehensive Error Log Version: 1 (1 sectors)
Device Error Count: 6 (device log contains only the most recent 4 errors)
	CR     = Command Register
	FEATR  = Features Register

Powered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as
DDd+hh:mm:SS.sss where DD=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes,
SS=sec, and sss=millisec. It "wraps" after 49.710 days.

Error 6 [1] occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 588 hours (24 days + 12 hours)
