Powered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as
DDd+hh:mm:SS.sss where DD=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes,
SS=sec, and sss=millisec. It "wraps" after 49.710 days.

Error 87 [2] occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 24272 hours (1011 days + 8 hours)
  When the command that caused the error occurred, the device was active or idle.
